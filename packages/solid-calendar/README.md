---

## Project Goals

- Front-end focused
  - Focus on developing a front-end architecture
  - No need for a back-end database, or logic API
  - Do not use libraries like FullCalendar
- Calendar features:
  - Ability to select other calendar months
  - Ability to add reminders for a given day
  - Reminders with title, city, date, and time
  - Ability to edit each reminder
  - Get weather forecast, if available, for each reminder
    - Forecast should be of the reminder date
    - Use a service like MetaWeather, AccuWeather, e.t.c
  - Automated tests to cover these functionalities
- Architecture features:
  - Inversion of control on all dependencies
    - Dependencies can be injected/swaped at runtime
  - Functional components, and state definition
    - Lazy-loadable modules
    - Isolated, and reusable functionality
