  "reasoning": "The feature requires:\n\n1. A function to create classes in backend: `AppError: (code: string) => Class<AppErrorType>`.\n\n\n## Defining feature requirements  \n- The feature needs a function to create error classes in the backend, specifically `AppError: (code: string) => Class<AppErrorType>`.  \n- This allows creating custom error classes, like `class AuthTokenError extends AppError(\"AUTH_TOKEN\") {}`.  \n- The function enables consistent error handling by generating class instances based on string codes.\n\n## Extending type definitions  \n- The feature requires a frontend function `matchErrorClass` to check if an object matches a specific error class, typed as `<E extends Class<AppErrorType>>(error: object, ErrorClass: E): error is { code: E[\"code\"] }`.  \n- `AppErrorType` is defined as an interface with a `code: string` property, likely extensible for additional properties.  \n\n## Refining function role  \n- `AppError` acts as a generator function, taking a code string and returning a class that extends `AppErrorType`.  \n- Custom error classes, like `AuthTokenError`, extend the class returned by `AppError`, ensuring type safety and consistency.\n\n## Refining function implementation  \n- Considered defining `AppError` as a function returning a constructor, like `new (...args: any[]) => AppErrorType`, to support class extension.  \n- Explored creating a base class `AppErrorBase` with a constructor setting the `code`, but found it complex for class generation.  \n\n## Simplifying class generation  \n- Proposed using a function `AppError` that returns a class extending a base error, ensuring the `code` property is set dynamically.  \n- Noted that TypeScript’s generics and class factories could simplify creating extensible error classes, aligning with the feature’s goals.\n\n## Refining type relationships  \n- Defined `Class<T>` as `{ new (...args: any[]): T }` to represent constructors returning objects of type `T`.  \n- Noted `E[\"code\"]` implies `E` is a constructor with instances having a `code` property, aligning with `AppErrorType`.  \n\n## Adjusting class structure  \n- Considered whether error classes should have a static `code` property for matching, fitting the `matchErrorClass` type guard.  \n- Proposed simplifying by ensuring `AppErrorType` instances consistently include `code: string`, supporting type safety.\n\n## Refining class structure  \n- Considered defining error classes with a static `code` property, like `static code = \"AUTH_TOKEN\"`, to support `matchErrorClass` functionality.  \n- Noted that instances of these classes should still have `code: string`, ensuring consistency with `AppErrorType`.  \n\n## Evaluating type guard logic  \n- Observed that `matchErrorClass` uses `error is { code: E[\"code\"] }`, but `E[\"code\"]` is invalid unless `E` has a static `code`.  \n- Suggested `error is InstanceType<E>` might be intended, aligning better with TypeScript type checking for error instances.\n\n## Crafting AppError implementation  \n- Defined `AppErrorType` as an interface requiring a `code: string` property for error instances.  \n- Explored creating `AppError` as a function that generates a class with both static and instance `code` properties.  \n\n## Refining type safety  \n- Attempted defining `AppError` to return a constructor extending `AppErrorType`, avoiding `as any` for type safety.  \n- Considered using `AppErrorBase` class to simplify inheritance, ensuring `code` is set via the constructor.\n\n## Enhancing class implementation  \n- Proposed using a base class `AppErrorBase` with both static and instance `code` properties, set via the constructor.  \n- Suggested `AppError` function returns a specialized class extending `AppErrorBase`, allowing dynamic `code` assignment.  \n\n## Streamlining error matching  \n- Defined `matchErrorClass` to check if an error has a `code` matching the static `code` of the error class.  \n- Noted `E['code']` refers to the static `code` type, enabling type-safe error matching in TypeScript.\n\n## Clarifying type narrowing  \n- Realized that `{ code: E['code'] }` results in `{ code: string }`, not narrowing to a specific code value, as `E[\"code\"]` is typed as `string` for `typeof AppErrorBase`.  \n- Noted the original intent likely aimed to narrow error types to specific instances, suggesting `error is InstanceType<E>` for better type checking.  \n\n## Revisiting type guard intent  \n- Identified that `matchErrorClass` seems meant to check if `error.code` matches `ErrorClass.code`, ensuring type safety for error instances.  \n- Suggested redefining the type guard as `: error is InstanceType<E>` to align with TypeScript’s instance-based type checking, improving accuracy.\n\n## Exploring simpler implementations  \n- Proposed a straightforward `AppError` function returning a class `ErrorClass` that implements `AppErrorType` with a public `code` property.  \n- Suggested `AuthTokenError` can extend the result, making error creation simpler without `as any`.  \n\n## Refining error class typing  \n- Attempted to define `matchErrorClass` using `instanceof` for type checking, but noted `E[\"code\"]` requires static properties for typing.  \n- Introduced `AppErrorClass` type with both a constructor and static `code`, aiming to improve type safety.\n\n## Refining base error class  \n- Explored defining `AppError` to create a base error class with a given `code`, aiming for type safety.  \n- Considered using `AppErrorConstructor` interface to combine constructor functionality with a static `code` property.  \n\n## Simplifying type implementation  \n- Proposed `ErrorGen` class within `AppError` to implement `AppErrorType` with a readonly `code` property, ensuring immutability.  \n- Noted the need for `as any` when assigning `code` to the constructor, indicating a potential type safety gap.  \n\n## Updating type guard approach  \n- Decided to modify the type guard to `error is InstanceType<E>`, improving type checking accuracy.",
