  "reasoning": "**Analyzing Code Requirements**\n\nI'm now focusing on the core structure needed for the `AppError` function, specifically how it will generate custom error classes with unique codes. Considering the factory pattern implementation, I'm weighing the optimal approach for class extension and error handling within the overall system design.\n\n\n**Designing the Factory Function**\n\nI'm now outlining the `AppError` function. The goal is to define the `Class<T>` type and the `AppErrorType` interface, ensuring adherence to the desired factory pattern. I'm leaning towards a base class, to handle common error functionalities and inheritance. The static `code` property is crucial, and I'm working out the best approach to make this both type-safe and easily accessible.\n\n\n**Refining Error Types**\n\nI've been working through the types required for the `AppError` factory. I've refined the `AppErrorType` interface to extend the built-in `Error` and now includes `code: string`. The `AppErrorClass` type now encompasses both the constructor and static `code` property. I'm also considering how to make the `code` property more strongly typed, perhaps using generics.\n\n\n**Implementing the AppError Factory**\n\nI've finalized the `AppError` function.  It now accepts a generic type `C` to represent the error code, ensuring type safety. Inside, I've created the `CustomError` class, which extends `Error` and includes static and instance `code` properties. I have added the `Object.setPrototypeOf` and `name` properties, which are necessary for better debugging.\n\n\n**Refining the Error Factory**\n\nI'm now examining the structure of the `AuthTokenError` to ensure it aligns with the `AppError` factory output. I will create the error class based on the function. It will be a subclass of `Error`, and now must incorporate a static code property. I'm also focusing on how to best integrate the `matchErrorClass` type guard.\n\n\n**Developing Type Guard Logic**\n\nI'm now focused on the `matchErrorClass` type guard. This involves creating the `AppErrorClassType` type, which represents a class with a static `code` and the necessary `AppErrorType` for the instance. The challenge is to write a type guard with a signature of  `<E extends AppErrorClassType>(error: object, ErrorClass: E): error is { code: E[\"code\"] } & object` to ensure code matching.\n\n\n**Combining and Finalizing Code**\n\nI'm now wrapping up the project by combining the `AppError` factory, the example `AuthTokenError`, and the `matchErrorClass` type guard into a single TypeScript file.  I'm also reviewing the type definitions to ensure that everything functions as intended, and that the type guard operates as expected. The final step is to test and confirm all components are properly implemented.\n\n\n**Integrating Complete Solution**\n\nI've completed the implementation, including the `AppError` factory, the example `AuthTokenError`, and the `matchErrorClass` type guard. I am pleased with the implementation's structure. I've reviewed the types and the resulting code, ensuring they all function as intended. I'll test it soon.\n\n\n**Consolidating the Code**\n\nI'm now focused on putting the final touches on the code. This involves integrating the `AppError` factory, the sample `AuthTokenError`, and the `matchErrorClass` type guard into a unified TypeScript file. I'm revisiting the type definitions and validating that the type guard works seamlessly, ensuring robust type safety.\n\n\n**Simplifying the Code**\n\nI'm now focusing on simplifying the type definitions. I've refined the `AppErrorClass` and `AppErrorType` to enhance readability and conciseness. The changes include using intersections and removing unnecessary interfaces. This should lead to cleaner, more efficient code.\n\n\n**Reviewing the Implementation**\n\nI've reviewed the implemented code again, consolidating the factory, example error, and type guard into a single file. I've simplified `AppErrorType` and the return type of the `AppError` function. I'm confident the refined types enhance readability and type safety.\n\n\n**Adapting to the Prompt**\n\nI'm now carefully refining the final code to precisely meet the provided instructions. I'm focusing on ensuring complete alignment with all requirements.\n\n\n**Revisiting Type Definitions**\n\nI'm now looking at further streamlining the code, particularly the type definitions for improved readability and conciseness. Considering the `AppErrorType` and its related types for consolidation to remove redundancies, and better alignment with the prompt.\n\n\n**Reviewing Code Implementation**\n\nI've reviewed the code again, integrating the factory, sample error, and the type guard into a single file. I've simplified the `AppErrorType` definition and clarified the `AppError` return type. I'm confident that the refined types and overall structure enhance readability and maintain type safety, while also adhering strictly to the prompt's original intent.\n\n\n**Streamlining the Code**\n\nI'm now simplifying the code. This involves removing the redundant `AppErrorType` interface and refining the `AppErrorClass`. I'm also adjusting the return type of `AppError` and the type parameters in `matchErrorClass` to improve readability and ensure compliance with the prompt's specifications, focusing on conciseness.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Implementation**\n\nI've now refined the code for the last time. The `AppError` factory, `AuthTokenError` example, and `matchErrorClass` type guard are all integrated. The code adheres to the specified requirements, including type safety and functionality. The focus has been on making the code concise. I'm confident in the final solution.\n\n\n**Reviewing the Code**\n\nI've reviewed the code again, and I'm satisfied with the current state. The code is refined and accurately reflects the requirements. I am confident in this version.\n\n\n**Adapting the Implementation**\n\nI'm now focusing on ensuring the implementation remains concise, easy to read, and follows the specifications. I am integrating the factory function, example error, and type guard, and revisiting the types and function signatures. The goal is to create a clear and easy to understand final solution.\n\n\n```typescript\n/**\n * The base type for an application error instance.\n */\ninterface AppErrorType extends Error {\n    readonly code: string;\n}\n\n/**\n * The type for an application error class created by the AppError factory.\n * It has a static readonly `code` and constructs AppErrorType instances.\n */\ntype AppErrorClass<C extends string = string> = {\n    new (message?: string): AppErrorType & { readonly code: C };\n    readonly code: C;\n};\n\n/**\n * A factory function to create custom AppError classes.\n * @param code The unique error code for this class.\n */\nfunction AppError<C extends string>(code: C): AppErrorClass<C> {\n    class CustomError extends Error implements AppErrorType {\n        public static readonly code: C = code;\n        public readonly code: C = code;\n\n        constructor(message?: string) {\n            super(message);\n            this.name = new.target.name;\n            Object.setPrototypeOf(this, new.target.prototype);\n        }\n    }\n    return CustomError;\n}\n\n/**\n * Example error class for authentication token issues.\n */\nclass AuthTokenError extends AppError(\"AUTH_TOKEN\") {}\n\n/**\n * A type guard to check if a caught error object matches a specific AppError class.\n * @param error The error object, typically from a network response body.\n * @param ErrorClass The AppError class to match against.\n */\nfunction matchErrorClass<E extends AppErrorClass>(\n    error: unknown,\n    ErrorClass: E\n): error is { readonly code: E[\"code\"] } & object {\n    return (\n        typeof error === \"object\" &&\n        error !== null &&\n        \"code\" in error &&\n        (error as { code: unknown }).code === ErrorClass.code\n    );\n}\n```\n\n**Generating the Final Code**\n\nI'm now carefully integrating the `AppError` factory, the example `AuthTokenError`, and the `matchErrorClass` type guard, ensuring adherence to the prompt's exact requirements while focusing on conciseness and clarity.\n\n\n",
