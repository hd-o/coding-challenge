  "reasoning": "**Developing Error Handling System**\n\nI'm currently working on building a TypeScript error handling system as requested.  I've started with the `AppError` function, crafting it to return a class extending `Error` and including a `code` property. This will be the foundational layer for custom error types.\n\n\n**Implementing Core Error Structure**\n\nI've made significant progress on the fundamental structure. The `AppError` function now generates classes extending `Error` and includes the necessary `code` property. I'm focusing on ensuring proper inheritance and type safety for the resulting error classes. I've also implemented the constructor logic, taking optional `message` and `options` parameters to mirror standard error behavior, along with setting `name` and `code` appropriately.\n\n\n**Designing Match Functionality**\n\nI'm now integrating the `matchErrorClass` function. It's designed to compare the `code` property of an error object with a given `ErrorClass`. This type guard will help identify custom error types within a larger error handling system. I'm focusing on ensuring type safety during comparisons to avoid any potential runtime errors. The function's implementation will revolve around accessing the static `code` property of the provided `ErrorClass`.\n\n\n**Constructing Custom Errors**\n\nI'm now focused on the `AppError` function itself. I've defined `AppErrorInstance` for the shape of the custom error instances, and `AppErrorCtor` for the constructor. The goal is to return a constructor that has both the `code` and `name` as static properties, mirroring the existing system. I'm working to ensure the created classes extend `Error` correctly and include the necessary properties. I'm taking care to correctly set both the instance and static versions of the `code` property.\n\n\n**Implementing Class Generation**\n\nI've significantly refined the `AppError` function and its related types. I've defined `AppErrorInstance` for the instance shape, `AppErrorCtor` for the constructor shape, and implemented the dynamic class generation. The function now returns a constructor with both static and instance `code` properties. I've also implemented the constructor logic, taking optional `message` and `options` parameters, and set `name` to the class name as expected. I'm satisfied that this is correct. I am now proceeding to the `matchErrorClass` function.\n\n\n**Refining Class Construction**\n\nI'm now revising the design and implementation of the class generation. The challenge is ensuring the `name` property of the dynamically generated error class accurately reflects the intended class name, especially when directly returned from `AppError`.  The `code` property is working correctly, both on the instance and statically. I'm carefully considering how to handle the static `name` and its potential implications for `matchErrorClass`, recognizing that the user-defined class name (like `AuthTokenError`) will naturally have its own static `name`.  The current implementation of the class sets up instance properties such as stack, name, and code in the constructor.  I am reviewing if other approaches might be required.\n\n\n**Refining Class Names and Matching**\n\nI'm now revising how `AppError` returns classes with static `code` properties and considering `matchErrorClass`. The direct return from `AppError` will be \"CustomAppError,\" but user-defined classes extending it, like `AuthTokenError`, will have their expected names. I'm focusing on ensuring `matchErrorClass` functions correctly with this dynamic class structure. The current emphasis is now on type-safety, which is the most critical component.\n\n\n**Developing Match Function**\n\nI've completed the implementation of the `matchErrorClass` function. It now functions as a type guard, correctly comparing the `code` of an error object with the static `code` property of a given `ErrorClass`. The `AppError` function returns the correct types and properties. Now, I am writing a comprehensive test suite to ensure the reliability and type safety of the entire system.\n\n\n**Developing `AppError` and `matchErrorClass`**\n\nI've finalized the `AppError` and `matchErrorClass` implementations, along with the example `AuthTokenError`. The core design focuses on returning a class with both static and instance `code` properties.  This ensures type-safety. I'm satisfied with how it handles dynamic class creation and the `matchErrorClass` type guard. I'm now writing a thorough test suite.\n\n\n```typescript\ninterface BaseAppErrorFields {\n  name: string;\n  code: string;\n  message: string;\n  stack?: string;\n  cause?: unknown;\n}\n\ninterface AppErrorCtor<TInstance extends BaseAppErrorFields> {\n  new (message?: string, options?: ErrorOptions): TInstance;\n  readonly code: string;\n  readonly name: string;\n}\n\nfunction AppError(code: string): AppErrorCtor<BaseAppErrorFields> {\n  class CustomAppError extends Error implements BaseAppErrorFields {\n    readonly code: string;\n    name: string;\n\n    constructor(message?: string, options?: ErrorOptions) {\n      super(message, options);\n      this.name = this.constructor.name;\n      this.code = CustomAppError.code;\n      Object.setPrototypeOf(this, CustomAppError.prototype);\n    }\n\n    static readonly code: string = code;\n  }\n  return CustomAppError;\n}\n\nclass AuthTokenError extends AppError(\"AUTH_TOKEN\") {}\n\nfunction matchErrorClass<E extends AppErrorCtor<BaseAppErrorFields>>(\n  error: object,\n  ErrorClass: E\n): error is { code: E[\"code\"] } {\n  if (\n    \"code\" in error &&\n    typeof (error as { code: unknown }).code === \"string\"\n  ) {\n    const errorCode = (error as { code: string }).code;\n    return errorCode === ErrorClass.code;\n  }\n  return false;\n}\n```\n\n\n**Implementing Custom Errors**\n\nI've completed the implementation of `AppError` and `matchErrorClass`, along with a basic `AuthTokenError` example.  `AppError` now returns a class with both instance and static `code` properties for robust type-safety. The type guard ensures accurate matching.  I am confident in its reliability and plan to start a test suite immediately.\n\n\n**Designing a Robust System**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in developing the error handling system. I've designed `BaseAppErrorFields`, `AppErrorCtor`, and `AppError`. I've ensured a clear distinction between the instance and the constructor shapes, providing strong type safety. `AuthTokenError` provides a clear example. The type guard `matchErrorClass` now works as expected and I've implemented the required jsdoc comments for the user. I'm focusing now on unit tests.\n\n\n",
