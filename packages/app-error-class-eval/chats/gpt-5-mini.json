  "reasoning": "**Clarifying TypeScript concerns**\n\nI see that TypeScript is giving me trouble with using a code variable in a static property initializer. It infers a wider type instead of just the literal. To help with typing, I might need to write `static readonly code: C = code;`, but I can't reference generic C in the class body. I can cast it using `static readonly code = code as C`, which is valid. Plus, when constructing, I need to ensure `message` isn't undefined. I’ll check the instanceOf when subclassing the Error and maybe think about exports and defining AppErrorType.**Implementing TypeScript with JSDoc**\n\nI need to use a TypeScript code fence to ensure everything is properly formatted. It’s important to include brief JSDoc comments above each function to explain what they do clearly. This will help anyone reading the code understand the purpose of each function at a glance. I should get started on implementing this now, and once that’s done, I'll focus on producing the final version. Let’s make sure it's all tidy and clear!",
