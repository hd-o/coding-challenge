# ðŸ›— Virtual Elevators

`#elevators` `#react` `#solid`

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)][demo]

Virtual elevators, powered by controller classes, and React components.

This project is a follow-up to [solid-calendar][solid_calendar], and [reactive-todos][reactive_todos], with the goal of achieving a SOLID architecture with React, while isolating logic functions from view components, being able to run these functions with other view frameworks, or even with physical devices. This project is a sibling to [rx-elevators][rx_elevators], which aims at the same goals while using function composition, without classes.

[MobX][mobx] was my preferred option for managing state in front-end applications, but for this project I decided to experiment with [RxJS][rxjs] for data observability, a decision I greatly appreciate. I later deep-dived into Rx while developing [rx-elevators][rx_elevators]
