Virtual elevators, powered by Rx streams, and React components.

This project is a follow-up to [solid-calendar][solid_calendar], with the goal of achieving a [SOLID][solid] architecture with [React][react], while isolating logic functions from view components, being able to run these functions with other view frameworks, or even with physical devices. This project is a sibling to [virtual-elevators][virtual_elevators], which aims at the same goals while using controller classes, not only function composition.

[MobX][mobx] was my preferred option for managing state in front-end applications, but while working on [virtual-elevators][virtual_elevators] I decided to experiment with [RxJS][rxjs] for handling data observability, a decision I greatly appreciate. In this project I deep dive into RxJS, coding the logic to virtual elevators entirely with observable streams, and function composition
