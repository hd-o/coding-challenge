    "A product's final price can be influenced by several factors: Discount based on product quantity, discount based on a brand's products quantity, coupons, loyalty plans, premium plans, e.t.c. On all purchases, two value types are certain, the product ids, and their quantities. With this data, transformations can be applied to calculate the final cart price. My current solution is to have \"price rules\" defining the calculation for a product price, and discounts if any. Example:"
